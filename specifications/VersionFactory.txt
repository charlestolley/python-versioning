versioning.VersionFactory API version 1.0.0
===========================================
A VersionFactory is a callable object that returns an instance of Version. The
version of Version that the factory returns is implementation-dependent.

Signature
---------
__call__(self, major: int, minor: int = 0, patch: int = 0): These three
    arguments correspond with the three parts of a Version number. The major
    version number is the only required argument.

Exceptions
----------
ValueError: Raised if any of the arguments are less than zero.
Aside from the above, and so long as all arguments use the correct data types,
    this call is non-throwing.
